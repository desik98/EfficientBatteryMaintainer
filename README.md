# EfficientBatteryMaintainer
Bash Script for MAC which maintains the battery between 40-80% i.e. if the battery percentage goes above 80% and if the ac adapter is plugged in, then notifications are send to unplug the ac adapter and similarly if the battery percentage goes below 40% and if the ac adapter is not plugged, then notifications are send to plug in the battery. It's good to maintain the battery percentage between 40-80 percent, doing so increases the battery life by 200% approx.
